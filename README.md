Additional Features are:
Web Scraping and Data Storage Application: A Python script was developed to scrape product data from Best Buy and store it in a local database table named "best_buy_products." This streamlined the data acquisition process, integrating the scraped data into the database for further analysis.

Moving Data from Relational Database to MongoDB: Python code was used to migrate data from a Relational Database to MongoDB, transferring records from the Customer, Sales, and Store tables within the EliteWork database. This demonstrated Python's capability in facilitating smooth cross-database data transitions.

Moving Data from CSSQL Database to Amazon RDS Database: A Python script enabled the transfer of the Store and Suppliers tables from the mm_team04_02 database in CSSQL to an Amazon RDS Database under the connection name "elitework," showcasing effective data migration between different database environments.
